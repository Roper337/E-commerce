# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
- 
This project acknowledges the use of a third-party API, [https://thecatapi.com/] and date sourced from , [https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker/], to enhance its functionality. The integration of this API has enabled certain features within the application.
